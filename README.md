# Simon-Game



# Description


The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players are required to follow a pattern of lights and sounds that repeat as the game progresses. The game starts with a sequence, and with each round, the sequence becomes longer. Players need to replicate the sequence by clicking the colored buttons. The game ends if the player clicks the wrong button, and they are prompted to restart.




# Features


->Simple yet addictive gameplay.
->A color and sound sequence is generated by the game, and the player has to repeat it.
->The game gets progressively harder with each level as the sequence length increases.
->Ability to restart the game when it is over.
->A visual cue for when the game is over, showing a red screen flash.

# Technologies Used

# HTML5 for the structure of the game.
# CSS3 for styling and animations.
# JavaScript (with jQuery) for interactivity and game logic.




# Instructions


1.Press the Start button to begin the game.
2.The game will display a sequence of colored buttons that you need to repeat.
3.Click the buttons in the correct order. If you make a mistake, the game will show a "Game Over" message and prompt you to restart.
4.The sequence will grow with each round, so you need to remember more steps as you progress.



# Game Logic
->Each button represents a color: red, green, blue, yellow.
->The sequence begins with one random color. As the game progresses, the sequence increases in length by one additional color.
->The player must replicate the sequence exactly, in the same order.
->If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends, and the player is prompted to restart.
